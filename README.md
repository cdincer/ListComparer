# ListComparer
Getting your GOG and Steam wishlist's showing how much they cost and how many games in them. 
Sorting them through lowest to highest. This is a hobby/educational project for me. If you see something that doesn't make sense, it's totally normal.
I wanted to use the theme from https://kristopolous.github.io/BOOTSTRA.386/ too. One of the reasons I made it.
Made with Visual Studio Code.</br>
Before starting it up open up frontend/Addresses.json copy/paste your Steam/GOG Wishlist.</br>
To run it:</br>
1- Do npm install -> npm run on frontend/</br>
2- Do dotnet run on backend/</br>
